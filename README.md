Features
Magic Fridge provides a simple and intuitive way to find cooking inspiration.
üîç Multi-Ingredient Search: Find recipes that contain all the ingredients you specify (e.g., "chicken, lemon, rice").
üé≤ Random Recipe: Don't know what to cook? Get a random recipe suggestion with a single tap.
üìñ Detailed Recipe View: Access complete recipe details, including a list of ingredients with measurements and step-by-step instructions.
‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites & Offline Access: Save your favorite recipes for later. All saved recipes are stored locally on your device and are available even without an internet connection.
üì± Modern, Responsive UI: A clean and simple user interface built entirely with Jetpack Compose.


Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is a showcase of modern Android development best practices, emphasizing a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture.
Tech Stack
UI: Jetpack Compose for building the entire UI declaratively.
Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) layered on top of a multi-module Clean Architecture.
Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow for all background operations and reactive data streams.
Dependency Injection: Koin for managing dependencies across the app.
Networking: Ktor Client for all remote API communication.
Local Storage: Room for persistent, offline storage of favorite recipes.
Navigation: Jetpack Navigation Compose for navigating between screens.
Image Loading: Coil 3 for efficiently loading and caching images from the web.
Architecture
The application is built following Clean Architecture principles, enforcing a strict separation of concerns between different layers of the app. This is achieved through a multi-module Gradle setup.
UI Layer ‚Üí Presentation Layer ‚Üí Domain Layer ‚Üí Data Layer
Domain Layer: The core of the application. It contains the business logic (use cases, though we used repository methods directly for simplicity) and business models (Recipe, Ingredient). It is a pure Kotlin module with no Android dependencies.
Data Layer: Responsible for providing data to the application. It contains the implementation of the repository, a remote data source (Ktor for TheMealDB API), and a local data source (Room database). It knows about the Domain layer but not the UI.
Presentation Layer (ViewModels): Part of the feature modules. It connects the UI to the domain layer, manages UI state, and handles user events.
UI Layer (Composables): The user-facing part of the app. It is a "dumb" layer that simply observes state from the ViewModels and sends user events to them.
Project Structure
The project is divided into several Gradle modules to enforce the architectural separation:
:app - The main application module that the user installs. It ties all the other modules together and handles top-level navigation.
:domain - Contains the core business models (Recipe) and the repository interface (RecipeRepository). Pure Kotlin.
:data - Implements the RecipeRepository. Contains all data-sourcing logic, including Ktor for networking and Room for the database, as well as DTOs and mappers.
:feature_search - A feature module containing all the UI and presentation logic for the online recipe search, home screen, and recipe detail view.
:feature_favorites - A feature module containing the UI and presentation logic for displaying the user's saved, offline recipes.
